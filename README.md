# Stormworks-Path-Drawer
Provides a GUI to draw paths (array of waypoints) over an stormworks map, allowing you to export it to a json or to a server to be acessed by stormworks's http api

Credits to Gavin Kistner for [his zooming/panning algorithm](http://phrogz.net/tmp/canvas_zoom_to_cursor.html), the zooming/panning code used in this repository is heavily based on his one.
